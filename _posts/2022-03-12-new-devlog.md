Intro
=====
	Life aboard station can get a bit dull. That's why many people choose the hazards of asteroid mining over the monotony of hydroponics or waste reclamation. 
	Some of these people have significant resources to buy and refit safe and reliable vessels to lessen the dangers inherent in vacuum mining operations.
	Some people of lesser means pool their resources to buy use mining ships with proven track records.
	You and your friends have managed to acquire a vessel at zero cost.
	The shining beacon of the good ship no-name-registered was described by the harbormaster as "not get that rusty piss bucket the hell away from my station before my workers start glowing in the dark."
	It may not be much and it may kill you all but it's yours and it's home.
