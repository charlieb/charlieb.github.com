        <h3>Petals</h3>
        <p>This is a great example of a very simple algorithm giving rise to
        complex and beautiful images.
        </p>
        <p>All there is to this algorithm is the idea that new petals try to
        move in the direction that will give them as much room as possible.

        </a>
        <p>You may think that I deliberately start the petals off in a
        spiral but no, I just drop them in the middle and let them find their
        own direction</p>
        <p>Here's how</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Drop a petal in the center</li>
          <li>Find the average position of all the other petals. This is the
          least desirable direction.</li>
          <li>Move in the opposite direction.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's all there is to it</p>

        <p>This was inspired by <a href="http://youtu.be/14-NdQwKz9w?t=2m15s">this part of this Vi Hart
          video</a> where she explains that this is exactly how real plants and
        flowers work (<a

          spiral videos</a>).

        <h3>Bacteria</h3>
        <p>From the beautiful to the wonderfully ugly. This demo is a simple
        bacteria like simulation</p>
        <a href="bacteria/index.html">
          <img src="images/bacteria.png">
          <p> Click for live version.</p>
        </a>
        <p>The black are the bacteria, red ones are about to die. The brown is
        erm ... waste.</p>
        <p>The static picture really doesn't do justice to the nasty
        suppurative roiling of the actual demo, check it out, ugh</p>
        <p>So how does it work?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An initial bacteria is dropped onto a clean surface</li>
          <li>It starts to grow, when it reaches a certain size it will
          split in two. The whole nasty mess starts from just a single
          bug</li>
          <li>Every once in a while each bacterium will create a pellet of
          waste. Over this time this waste will disappear.</li>
          <li>When a bacteria is touching a poop it will suffer from toxic
          effects and get closer to death.</li>
          <li>Bacteria try to stick to other bacteria, not too close but
          they like to clump together, of course this increases the
          concentration of their toxic excreta</li>
          <p> The only way for the bacteria to die is from toxic overload.
          There is no set lifetime nor a limit to the number of bacteria.
          Their numbers are kept in check purely by the toxicity of their
          waste.</p>
          <p>For me that's the most interesting thing about this simulation.
          There's a number in the source code for this that controls the level
          of toxicity of the waste. Tiny changes in this number are the
          difference between a population that immediately dies out, one that
          multiplies out of control until my browser runs out of memory and is
          killed and one that increases only up to a stable
          population</p>
          <p>There's a metaphor for humanity in there somewhere</p>
