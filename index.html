        <h3>Petals</h3>
        <p>This is a great example of a very simple algorithm giving rise to
        complex and beautiful images.
        </p>
        <p>All there is to this algorithm is the idea that new petals try to
        move in the direction that will give them as much room as possible.

        <p>You may think that I deliberately start the petals off in a
        spiral but no, I just drop them in the middle and let them find their
        own direction.</p>
        <p>Here's how:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Drop a petal in the center.</li>
          <li>Find the average position of all the other petals. This is the
          least desirable direction.</li>
          <li>Move in the opposite direction.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>That's all there is to it.</p>
        <p>Well almost, just for fun I made the petals change the direction
        they're pointing to make it a little more interesting once it's
        finished and all the petal positions are fixed.</p>

        <p>This was inspired by <a
          href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=14-NdQwKz9w&t=2m15s">this part of this Vi Hart
          video</a> where she explains that this is exactly how real plants and
        flowers work (<a
          href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahXIMUkSXX0">watch all 3 natural
          spiral videos</a>).

        <h3>Bacteria</h3>
        <p>From the beautiful to the wonderfully ugly. This demo is a simple
        bacteria like simulation</p>
        <a href="bacteria/index.html">
          <img src="images/bacteria.png">
          <p> Click for live version.</p>
        </a>
        <p>The black are the bacteria, red ones are about to die. The brown is
        erm ... waste.</p>
        <p>The static picture really doesn't do justice to the nasty
        suppurative roiling of the actual demo, check it out, ugh.</p>
        <p>So how does it work?</p>
        <ul>
          <li>An initial bacterium is dropped onto a clean surface.</li>
          <li>It starts to grow, when it reaches a certain size it will
          split in two. The whole nasty mess starts from just a single
          bug.</li>
          <li>Every once in a while each bacterium will create a pellet of
          waste. Over this time this waste will disappear.</li>
          <li>When a bacterium is touching a poop it will suffer from toxic
          effects and get closer to death.</li>
          <li>Bacteria try to stick to other bacteria, not too close but
          they like to clump together, of course this increases the
          concentration of their toxic excreta.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> The only way for the bacteria to die is from toxic overload.
        There is no set lifetime nor a limit to the number of bacteria.
        Their numbers are kept in check purely by the toxicity of their
        waste.</p>
        <p>For me, that's the most interesting thing about this simulation.
        There's a number in the source code that controls the
        toxicity of the waste. Tiny changes in this number are the
        difference between a population that immediately dies out, one that
        multiplies out of control until my browser runs out of memory and
        crashes and one that increases only up to a stable population.</p>
        <p>There's a metaphor for humanity in there somewhere.</p>

        <h3>Bezier Curves</h3>
        <p>Bezier curves are fairly simple parametric curves that smoothly move
        between specified control points.</p>
        <a href="bezier/index.html">
          <img src="images/bezier.png">
          <p> Click for animated version.</p>
        </a>
        <p>You can read all about the details of Bezier curves and play with
        them at this excellent site: <a
          href="http://processingjs.nihongoresources.com/bezierinfo"/>Bezier
          curves - a primer</a></p>
        <p>The trick here, is that to look like a continuous loop each section
        of the curve must line up with the next perfectly.</p>
        <p>I don't think you can see the joins in the animation so that means I
        must have got it right.</p>
        <p>If you've looked at the demo then you can see that there's a little
        more to it than just static curves. The rest is just picking the
        control points and moving them around.</p>
        <p>There are two sets of points that the curve moves through: one
        spaced around the edge of a circle alternating with ones spaced around
        the edge of an ellipse.</p>
        <p>Both the circle's radius and the two axes of the ellipse are changing
        size in time with a sine wave. If you pick a point on the curve and
        watch it you can see the characteristic fast-slow-fast movement of the
        sine wave.</p>
        <p>The points are also marching around the two shapes which is what gives
        rise to the rotation of the figure overall. Not to be outdone the
        ellipse is also rotating. You can see the curve reach out to its widest
        point and how the widest point rotates around the figure.</p>

        <h3>Flocking and Herding</h3>
        <p>A game where the objective is to get the sheep dipped and keep them
        away from the cliff.</p>
        <a href="boids/index.html">
          <img src="images/boids.png">
          <p> Click to play.</p>
        </a>
        <p>You control the one with the red circle. All the others will run
        away from you.</p>
        <p>Use the arrow keys to move around: up to accelerate, down to
        decelerate, left and right to turn.</p>
        <p>Flocking and herding is a combination of three behaviours:
        repulsion, alignment and attraction. These behaviours only require local
        information, no overall controller is necessary. All the different
        herds, flocks, schools, gaggles and murders you see in nature can be 
        modelled with just these three behaviours.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Repulsion: don't get too close to your neighbours, if you are too
          close move away. This behaviour activates at the smallest range.</li>
          <li>Alignment: try to match speed and direction with you fellows.
          This behaviour activates at a moderate range.</li>
          <li>Attraction: move towards others. This behaviour activates at
          the largest distance.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Attraction brings flocks together and keeps them together. Repulsion
        stops individuals from colliding with one-another. Alignment is
        responsible for the incredible feats of coordination and synchronised
        movement that flocks are capable of.</p>
        <p>Programs that flock like this are known as boids (bird like-object,
        I prefer to think of it as bird-droids)</p>
        <p>There's ton's of information out there about boids but I think this
        page is the best: <a href="http://www.red3d.com/cwr/steer/">Craig
          Reynolds' Steering Behaviors</a>. It has great demos and
        descriptions of a range of different programs like boids. Craig
        Reynolds invented the boid so it's no wonder his page is the best</p>
